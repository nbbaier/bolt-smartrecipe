## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Components**: Custom components with Radix UI primitives
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **State**: React hooks + Context for global state

### Backend Stack
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **ORM**: Drizzle + drizzle-kit
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS)

### Development Tools
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint + TypeScript ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier (to be added)
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode

## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Clean and Modern**: Minimalist interface with clear hierarchy
- **Color System**: Comprehensive palette with primary, secondary, accent colors
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper sizing scale
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear menu structure and breadcrumbs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, proper contrast, ARIA labels

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Reusable, single-responsibility components
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized component APIs
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized file structure for growth

## Sample Data Strategy

### Initial Data Sets
- **Ingredients**: ~100 common pantry items with categories
- **Recipes**: ~50 diverse recipes with ingredient lists
- **Categories**: Food categories, dietary restrictions, cuisine types
- **Units**: Measurement units (metric/imperial)

### Mock Data Approach
- Start with static JSON data
- Implement data services layer for easy backend integration
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- [ ] Intuitive navigation (easy to find features)
- [ ] Fast performance (quick load times)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (works well on all devices)
- [ ] Accessible design (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Functionality
- [ ] Complete CRUD operations for all data types
- [ ] Accurate ingredient-recipe matching
- [ ] Reliable expiration tracking
- [ ] Effective search and filtering

### Code Quality
- [ ] Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- [ ] Modular, maintainable component architecture
- [ ] Consistent design system usage
- [ ] Proper error handling and loading states

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm requirements** with stakeholder
2. **Set up development environment** with proper tooling
3. **Create design system** and component library
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** with core UI foundation
