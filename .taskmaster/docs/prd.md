## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Project Overview**

SmartRecipe is a web application that aims to simplify home cooking by offering intelligent pantry management, AI-powered recipe discovery, and cooking assistance. Its primary goals are to reduce food waste by encouraging the use of existing ingredients and to enhance the overall cooking experience. The application is built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and leverages Supabase for backend services.

### **1.2 Purpose of this Document**

This PRD outlines the essential features, functionalities, and user experience requirements for the SmartRecipe application, serving as a condensed guide for development.

### **1.3 Target Audience**

Home cooks, food enthusiasts, and individuals seeking efficient meal planning and reduced food waste.

## **2\. Business Goals & Objectives**

-  **Reduce Food Waste:** Enable users to maximize the use of their pantry ingredients.
-  **Streamline Meal Preparation:** Provide intuitive tools for pantry, recipe, and shopping list management.
-  **Enhance Cooking Experience:** Deliver smart insights and assistance.
-  **Increase User Engagement:** Create a valuable and frequently used culinary management platform.

## **3\. Scope**

### **3.1 In-Scope Features (Current & Near-Term)**

Based on the existing codebase and immediate development priorities:

#### **3.1.1 User Authentication & Profile Management**

-  Secure user registration, login, and protected application routes.
-  Comprehensive user profiles: view/edit personal details, cooking preferences (dietary, cuisine, skill), and kitchen equipment.
-  User settings for notifications, privacy, account security (password change), and app preferences (measurement system, language).
-  Enhanced onboarding process for collecting profile data.

#### **3.1.2 Pantry Management**

-  **Ingredient Inventory:** Add, view, edit, and delete ingredients with details like quantity, unit, expiration date, and notes.
-  **Smart Input:** Manual input with mock support for voice and photo-based ingredient addition.
-  **Expiration Tracking:** Highlight ingredients nearing or past expiration.
-  **Bulk Operations:** Support for bulk deletion, expiration date updates, and CSV export.
-  Ability to mark ingredients as "leftovers."

#### **3.1.3 Recipe Management**

-  **Recipe Discovery:** Browse, search, and filter recipes by difficulty or pantry ingredient availability ("Can Cook" section).
-  **Recipe Details:** View comprehensive recipe information (ingredients, instructions, times, servings, mock nutrition).
-  **Recipe Import (Mocked):** Input a URL to simulate scraping and displaying recipe details (persistence mocked).
-  Bookmark recipes for easy access.

#### **3.1.4 Shopping List Management**

-  Create and manage shopping lists, adding items with quantity/unit.
-  Mark items as purchased and clear purchased items.
-  Search and filter list items, with auto-suggestion from a master ingredient database.

#### **3.1.5 AI Assistant**

-  **Simulated AI Chat:** A basic chat interface for cooking queries with mocked responses.
-  Provide quick prompt buttons and display curated cooking tips.
-  Future plans for real AI integration with pantry awareness.

### **3.2 Out-of-Scope Features (for current phase)**

-  Real-time AI integration (replacing mocks).
-  Advanced recipe import persistence and full custom recipe creation/editing.
-  Advanced shopping list features (e.g., sharing, custom items).
-  Full performance, accessibility, and PWA support beyond current responsive design.
-  Extensive testing coverage.
-  Social features, external API integrations (grocery, smart devices), and advanced analytics.

## **4\. User Stories (Examples)**

-  As a user, I want to quickly add ingredients to my pantry and see what's expiring soon, to reduce food waste.
-  As a user, I want to find recipes I can cook with ingredients I already have, without needing to go shopping.
-  As a user, I want to manage my shopping list efficiently, marking items as purchased.
-  As a user, I want a cooking assistant to give me tips or recipe ideas.

## **5\. Functional Requirements (Summary)**

The system will provide robust user authentication, allowing users to manage their personal profiles, dietary preferences, and kitchen equipment. It will enable comprehensive pantry management, including ingredient tracking, expiration alerts, and bulk operations. Users will be able to discover and manage recipes, including mock importing from URLs and bookmarking favorites. A functional shopping list will support adding and tracking items. A simulated AI assistant will provide cooking guidance through a chat interface.

## **6\. Non-Functional Requirements (Summary)**

-  **Performance:** Fast page loads and API responses, responsive UI interactions.
-  **Security:** Secure storage of user data (Supabase RLS), adherence to authentication best practices, and input validation.
-  **Usability & UX:** Intuitive navigation, consistent design, clear feedback, and loading indicators.
-  **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines where possible (keyboard navigation, color contrast).
-  **Scalability:** Backend capable of handling growing user and data volumes.
-  **Maintainability:** Modular, well-structured, and documented codebase with regular dependency updates.

## **7\. Technical Requirements**

-  **Frontend:** React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Shadcn/ui.
-  **State Management:** React Hooks, custom hooks.
-  **Routing:** React Router DOM.
-  **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS).
-  **ORM:** drizzle and drizzle-kit
-  **Build Tool:** Vite.
-  **Libraries:** Lucide React (icons), React Hook Form (forms), Zod (validation), date-fns (date handling).

## **8\. Future Considerations**

-  Full integration of real AI models (e.g., Gemini API) for pantry-aware suggestions.
-  Advanced recipe creation and persistent import.
-  Enhanced shopping list collaboration and smart features.
-  Full cooking session tracking and guidance.
-  Improved mobile PWA support, animations, and accessibility.
-  Comprehensive testing suite.
-  Social features and third-party integrations (e.g., grocery store APIs).
